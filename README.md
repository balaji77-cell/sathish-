Certainly! **Zomato** offers a range of services related to food delivery and dining experiences. Here are some key aspects:

1. **Zomato Infrastructure Services (ZIS)**: ZIS is a kitchen infrastructure service where Zomato collaborates with existing restaurant owners to expand their business to more locations without fixed costs. These "cloud kitchens" focus on delivery-only food courts in accessible areas. Each location hosts multiple restaurant brands, sharing costs and resources. Zomato provides real estate, builds the kitchen, and supplies equipment. The tech stack includes Zomato Base (POS) and Zomato Trace (Delivery Dispatching and Routing)¹.

2. **Food Delivery**: Zomato's primary service is food delivery. Users can explore restaurants, view menus, read reviews, and place orders through the app. Live order tracking is available.

3. **Restaurant Information**: Zomato provides detailed information about restaurants, including ratings, reviews, and current menus.

4. **Pure Veg Fleet**: Recently, Zomato launched a vegetarian-only delivery service called the "Pure Veg Fleet." It caters to those who prefer ordering from pure-veg restaurants and uses green delivery boxes⁴.
